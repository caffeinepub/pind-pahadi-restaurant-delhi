  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented. REQ-1 is addressed by updating frontend/index.html with the corrected domain in canonical, og:url, JSON-LD @id, url, and hasMenu fields. REQ-2 is addressed by adding retry logic in useQueries.ts, exposing actorFetching state, and updating Contact.tsx to show a Connecting banner and disable submission while the actor initializes. The backend submitBooking function is also made caller-agnostic with no auth check. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
