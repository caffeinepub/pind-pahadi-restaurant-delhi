  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements: REQ-1 (fix admin dashboard bookings visibility via proper paymentDetails passing in useSubmitBooking and query invalidation), REQ-2 (restore payment details section in Contact.tsx booking form with PaymentDetails stored in backend), and REQ-3 (BookingConfirmation component with a download/screenshot button using a print window). All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",

    {
      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) for transforming old booking records with a 'deposit' field into the new PaymentDetails structure was added.",
      "reason": "The build request does not mention data migration or backward compatibility with old booking schema. This is an unrequested addition beyond the stated requirements.",

        "backend/migration.mo"

      "description": "Payment screenshot upload feature in the booking form — users can upload a screenshot file of their payment as part of the booking submission.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 asks for entering/viewing payment-related information (advance amount, payment method, UPI/bank details), but does not request a file upload input for a payment screenshot. The screenshotFileName field and file input UI were added beyond the stated requirement.",
